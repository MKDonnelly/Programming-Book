# Programming-Book
A book on introductory C++ programming I wrote as part of my startup company CS Master.  My goal in developing this book was to introduce each programming construct in a problem-solution format.  For example, loops are introduced to solve the problem of writing the same line of code over and over.  I believe that this approach is best for solidifying how and when to use each programming construct for students.
